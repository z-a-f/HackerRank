Watson gives Sherlock an array A1,A2...AN. 
He asks him to find an integer M between P and Q(both inclusive), such that, min {|Ai-M|, 1 ≤ i ≤ N} is maximised. If there are multiple solutions, print the smallest one.

Input Format 
The first line contains N. The next line contains space separated N integers, and denote the array A. The third line contains two space separated integers denoting P and Q.

Output Format 
In one line, print the required answer.

Constraints 
1 ≤ N ≤ 102 
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 
1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ 109

Sample Input

3
5 8 14
4 9
Sample Output

4
Explanation 
For M = 4,6,7, or 9, the result is 1. Since we have to output the smallest of the multiple solutions, we print 4.
