Sample input

3
10 2 5
12 4 4
6 2 2
Sample Output

6
3
5
Explanation 
In the first case, he can buy 5 chocolates with $10 and exchange the 5 wrappers to get one more chocolate thus making the total number of chocolates he can eat as 6

In the second case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $12. However, it takes 4 wrappers to get one more chocolate. He can't avail the offer and hence the total number of chocolates remains 3.

In the third case, he can buy 3 chocolates for $6. Now he can give 2 of this 3 wrappers and get 1 chocolate. Again, he can use his 1 unused wrapper and 1 wrapper of new chocolate to get one more chocolate. Total is 5.
